    <dt>Gym – Space, Design, and Layout</dt>
    <dd> To perform well, a gym has to be designed with a lot of thought and care – the facility has to be spacious,
      <!-- Iteration 3: Mark accommodate as important text using <strong> tag -->
      well structured, and properly organized to be able to <strong>accommodate</strong> a lot of user
    </dd>
    <dt>Quality Gym Flooring</dt>
    <dd>A good gym must have a good floor.
      Quality flooring is key for a safe, attractive,
      and high-performing sports facility – it must provide users with the
      right conditions for practicing their favorite sport and make them feel
      comfortable and welcome in the gym. The floor has to be resilient enough
      <!-- Iteration 3: Mark aerobic exercises as important text using strong tag -->
      for weightlifting and <strong>aerobic exercises</strong>, must provide superb shock absorption

      and <i>cushioning</i> to ensure the safety of the a <i>thletes</i>, and needs to have
      excellent resistance to heavy impact load (so it can withstand thousands
      of pounds of fitness equipment).

    <dt>Community and Socializing</dt>
    <dd>With social distancing and stay-at-home orders, many people are feeling more isolated and lonelier.
      <!-- Iteration 6: use delete element for environment -->
      Mental health is a huge topic right now and creating an <del>environment</del> that nurtures human
      connection is hugely attractive.</dd>
    <dd>Many of the most successful fitness brands have a thriving community of like-minded individuals.
      They encourage members to socialize and continue to develop their fitness community both online and offline.</dd>

    <dt>Clean and Hygienic</dt>
    <dd>Cleanliness and hygiene have always been important factors when it comes to investing in a gym membership or visiting a
      fitness facility. But now, cleanliness is a major consumer priority.There is a new awareness of how germs
      spread and anxiousness surrounding high touchpoints and close proximity to other people.
      Your facility needs to be disinfected, cleaned and sanitized regularly in order to meet consumer expectations.
      It’s a good idea to share your COVID-19 cleaning protocols with members
      to reassure your community that it’s safe to exercise</dd>

    <dt>Training Ability </dt>
    <dd>The training abilities you cater to will play a part in who joins your gym. If you focus on high
      performance and improving personal bests in a specific area, an entry-level gym-goer isn’t
      going to sign up. While it’s important to niche down,
      having options for various training abilities is useful when creating a welcoming and accessible environment. </dd>
