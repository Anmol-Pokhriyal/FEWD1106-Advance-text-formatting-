      Quality flooring is key for a safe, attractive,

      right conditions for practicing their favorite sport and make them feel
      comfortable and welcome in the gym. The floor has to be resilient enough

      fitness facility. But now, cleanliness is a major consumer priority.There is a new awareness of how germs
      spread and anxiousness surrounding high touchpoints and close proximity to other people.
      Your facility needs to be disinfected, cleaned and sanitized regularly in order to meet consumer expectations.
      It’s a good idea to share your COVID-19 cleaning protocols with members
      to reassure your community that it’s safe to exercise</dd>

    <dt>Training Ability </dt>

      performance and improving personal bests in a specific area, an entry-level gym-goer isn’t
      going to sign up. While it’s important to niche down,
      having options for various training abilities is useful when creating a welcoming and accessible environment. </dd>
      <!-- Iteration 10:provide subscript for o2 -->
      <dd>Training results in an increase in the efficiency of O<sub>2</sub> transport within the body. 
        By lowering the resting heart rate (HR), and the HR at sub maximal loads, the heart pumps 
        more blood with every heart beat. This, in addition to other physiological changes, 
        increases the oxygen extraction capability.</dd>
